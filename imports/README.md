# Project Structure - `/imports`

The `/imports` folder is the root folder for all the modules we will be writing for the applications. It is broken down into four folders:

- `/imports/api` : This folder contains all domain logic for each of our models.
- `/imports/startup` : This folder contains bootstrapping logic.
- `/imports/ui` : This folder contains all templates and client logic.
- `/imports/utils` : This folder contains utility functions.
