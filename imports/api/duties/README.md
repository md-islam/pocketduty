# Project Structure - `imports/api/duties`

This folder contains all the logic for the Duty model. The model definition should go within `duties.js`, and the Meteor methods you write to expose functionality for the duties needs to go in `methods.js`. 

The `/server` folder contains only one file: `publications.js`. That file simply declares all the publications we will subscribe to in the client.
